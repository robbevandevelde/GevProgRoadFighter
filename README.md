[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thibautvangoethem/GevProgRoadFighter.svg?token=eqCtdW2odoztZxrP7EYN&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thibautvangoethem/GevProgRoadFighter)

This is a project made by Thibaut Van Goethem for the course "gevorderd programmeren"
The project is an implementation of the NES game roadfighter using SFML 2.4

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<b>- SFML 2.4</b><br>
<b>- cmake 3.6 minimum</b><br>
<b>- a version of gcc/g++ or clang (tested with gcc 7.3.0 but most version should do)</b><br>
<b>- linux (preferably ubuntu), other operating systems have not been tested</b><br>

<h2>how to run</h2><br>
<h3>command line:</h3><br>
<b>- clone the project from github</b><br>
<b>- make new directory </b><br>
<b>- cd into that directory</b><br>
<b>- run cmake from the new directory onto the directory you cloned the project in</b><br>
<b>- run make in the directory you made</b><br>
<b>- the compiled version can now be found in the SFMLConversion map and is named GevProgRoadFighter</b><br>
<br>
<b> note 1: if you were to move the compiled version be sure to also move the resources directory with it</b><br>
<b> note 2: test made with the google framework can now also be run with the compiled version in the Tests directory</b><br>

<h2> controls</h2>
<b>left/right arrow key: move left/right</b><br>
<b>up/down arrow key: accelerate/decelerate</b><br>
<b>space: shoot (you can only shoot once in a certain time)</b><br>
<b>escape: pause game or exit at the end</b><br>
